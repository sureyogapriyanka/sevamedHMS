# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

**Windows Users**: If npm is not recognized, you can run the frontend using the batch file:

Double-click on `start_frontend.bat` in the frontend folder

OR run the following command in Command Prompt:

```
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\src\sevaonline\frontend
"C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" node_modules/react-scripts/bin/react-scripts.js start
```

This will start the app in development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to GitHub Pages.\
This command will build the app and deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch.\
Make sure you have configured GitHub Pages in your repository settings.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This application is configured for deployment to GitHub Pages:

1. The backend API is configured to connect to your Render backend at:
   `https://sevamed-backend.onrender.com/api`

2. Automatic deployment is configured through GitHub Actions:
   - See `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml` for details
   - Deployment happens automatically on pushes to the `main` branch

3. Manual deployment:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
